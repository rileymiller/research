  annote    = {Kurt Thearling et al. provide an excellent review of the most recent work in
               the arena of data visualization. Although the work is not intended
               for IVE applications, most of the ideas were instrumental in understanding some
               of the inherent difficulties in data visualization. For example, from this
               work it became evident to us that \emph{orienteering} is one of the most important
               aspects in an IVE. This indicates that it is important to examine possible solutions
               to properly orient the user early in the project. Some of the ideas presented
               includes maintaining a grid that defines the three axes $(x, y, z)$ and the notion
               of a companion menu that, when invoked, aids the user in locating and transporting
               themselves within the environment. The authors also emphasize the importance of
               ``trusting the model.'' Trust here refers to the user's ability to comfortably
               rely on the methods provided to correctly interpret the visual
               presentation at hand.}
