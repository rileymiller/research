### Micro Job Platform Notes
Riley Miller


- Tasks on MTurk are called HITs, or human intelligence tasks. Posted by requesters.
    - Workers make money by doing the tasks, the Requesters get results from the work performed by the workers
- Hundreds of thousands of tasks, surveys are one of the most important type of HIT. Other types of work include: audio/video transcription, categorization tasks, excel work, Youtube video rating, etc. 
- Work is available immediately after signing up but some of the better tasks require that you perform a certain number of HITs before being eligible to do the task.
- Some people are able to make $150-$300/wk as a side job.

Email: kevin_0221@hotmail.com

Scraped url: https://www.laceysoccer.com/

Text surrounding the email:

Based on the scraped information, we are trying to make our best guess on the first name, last name, and job title to associate with the owner of the email. Sometimes the information we are looking for can be found in the surrounding text. Sometimes, the information can be found in the url. And sometimes, the name can be easily inferred from the email. If you cannot find that information, try going to the website url to look for more information. (You shouldn't need to spend a lot of time digging around on the internet)

In some cases, it will be impossible to determine the first name, last name, or job title based on the information given. And that's okay.

Based on the above information, please fill out the below form values to the best of your ability:

What is their first name?

example: John
What is their last name?

example: Doe
What is their title? (Make your best guess: If information is available, be as specific as possible. If the information is not available, leave it blank)

example: President, Coach, Director, Parent
```

Areas for optimization could be how to price a task to encourage workers to pick it up based off of supply and demand.

Workers want to make the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time.
- Eliminate context switching so they can do alot of one one task
- Want high paying tasks which don't take a ton of time

Requesters want high quality work (best worker for the job), with the shortest feedback loop, for the lowest price

Use ML to optimize this relationship.

Many people are trying to collect data but it's hard to know that the workers are being honest or to verify what they're saying is true.
