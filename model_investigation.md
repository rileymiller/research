# Model Investigation
Thoughts on potential ML model architecture and algorithms.

- Baseline comparison with shallow models. Key in on logistic regression which is commonly used in recommending systems.

- Deep learning as a standalone approach, faulty for overgenerralizing.

- Hybrid Approach

### Deep Learning with Python
Introduction to Keras and TensorFlow (TF). Either going to use TF or PyTorch to build model.
