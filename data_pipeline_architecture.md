# Data Pipeline Architecture

Will likely construct preliminary data pipeline on platform candidates with developer friendly APIs.

### Data Collection Ideas
My first idea for the data collection process, similar to what was discussed with Dr. Yue, is to create a Google Chrome Extension which will store user data locally on the user's device. This data can be encrypted to ensure user privacy but this data will be useful for collaborative impressions based on users' contextual information as well as their interaction with the micro job platform. When a user is created, the user's information will be stored in a cloud-based microservice which will record the user's characteristic data without storing the user's personal data. This Chrome extension will prove useful because it will allow us to garner user data from their interactions with the micro job platform such as what queries they enter and what HITs they choose to pursue. This architecture will be useful because it will give me the data I need to develop models to help offer relevant recommendations based on user preferences, user history, and additional context.
